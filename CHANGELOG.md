## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Auto-capture screen when opening permission modal
  - Automatically captures terminal screen when modal opens in waiting_input state
  - No need to manually press the Capture button

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Permission prompt navigation from mobile** - Respond to Claude Code permission dialogs remotely
  - Direction pad (D-Pad) for arrow key navigation (up/down/left/right) and Enter key

- Swap screen capture and direction pad positions in mobile UI for better UX
- Remove Swift/Xcode dependency for screen capture (pure AppleScript implementation)
- Hide message section when waiting for permission prompt

### Fixed

- Fix captured screen image not displaying on mobile

- Skip AppleScript-based tests on CI environment (prevents timeout on GitHub Actions)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **Tailscale support** for secure remote mobile access
  - New `-t, --tailscale` option to prefer Tailscale IP for mobile server
  - Access mobile web UI from anywhere in your Tailnet (not just local Wi-Fi)
  - WireGuard encryption provides secure communication over any network
  - Automatic fallback to local IP if Tailscale is not connected

### Changed

- Extract `resolveServerIP()` function to reduce code duplication

## [1.1.11] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Fix Ghostty focus from Web UI when Ghostty is in background

## [1.1.10] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Fix Ghostty focus not working when multiple windows are open
  - Click Window menu item twice (Ghostty quirk: first selects tab, second brings window to front)
  - Use `name` attribute instead of `title` for Window menu search
  - Add `AXRaise` to ensure window comes to front
  - Remove `activate` call that brought ccn window back to front
- Fix Web UI sendText/sendKeystroke targeting wrong session in Ghostty
  - Focus correct tab before sending text/keystroke

### Changed

- Simplify Ghostty focus logic by removing complex tab cycling in favor of Window menu click

## [1.1.9] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed

- Improve Ghostty focus timing for multi-tab windows
  - Use menu-based tab navigation ("Show Next Tab") instead of keystroke-based approach
  - Works reliably regardless of user keybinding configuration
  - Iterate through all windows and tabs to find the target session

### Added

- Auto-detect Ghostty and prompt for `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE` setting
  - Prevents Claude Code from overwriting terminal titles during execution
  - Required for reliable tab identification in Ghostty
  - Prompt appears on `ccn` launch or `ccn setup` for Ghostty users
  - User's choice is remembered to avoid repeated prompts

### Changed

- Separate confirmation prompts for hooks setup and Ghostty settings
- Remove unused internal exports for cleaner API

## [1.1.8] - 2026-01-24

### Security

- Bind server to specific IP instead of 0.0.0.0
  - Server now listens only on the IP displayed in QR code
